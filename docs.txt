1. Setting of data:

	I simplified the data handling in additional options. Its setup is database ready so the dev who will work on this will have an ease on continuing it.
	{
		price: decimal
		title: string
		description: string | nullable 
		multiple: {
			exist: boolean,
			value: integer
		}		
		active: boolean
	}

2. If the option is switched to active, the default value of multiple will be set to 1
3. If the option is switched to inactive, the value of multiple will be set to 0
4. The active option can be switched ONLY by clicking its X icon (close button)
